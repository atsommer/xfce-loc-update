Ariel Sommer 2016

Updates the location-related information on an XFCE system
currently updates the following:
    system time zone
    weather app location
    
Installation (local):
---------------------
download the code and put it somewhere you want it to stay (THE_PATH)
run the install script to create symlinks in ~/bin
$ bash install-loc-update 
keep the files you downloaded in THE_PATH, they are called via symlinks

Make sure your PATH includes ~/bin 
If it doesn't, add the following at the end of ~/.bashrc:
PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Optional: If you have a geonames account,
create a file called THE_PATH/geonames containing just your username
Otherwise, you will be using the "demo" account which occasionally hits a limit

Usage:
---------------------
call the main script from anywhere, it's on your path:
$ update-loc [info]

You can use info to specify a postal code, city, state, etc.
If info is not given, your location will be determined automatically, but 
imprecisely. Both modes require an internet connection.
examples strings for info:
    "new york"
    cambridge
    cambridge,uk
    paris
    "paris, tx"
    chicago
    90210
    

Uninstall:
----------------------
go to THE_PATH and run:
$ bash uninstall-loc-update
to remove the symlinks
Then delete THE_PATH
